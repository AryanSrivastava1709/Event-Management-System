## âœ… Core Microservices Required

| Service Name         | Purpose                                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Eureka Server** | Service Registry â€” allows other microservices to register themselves |
| **2. API Gateway**   | Central gateway â€” routes all API requests + handles JWT filtering    |
| **3. Registration**  | User registration (store in DB, validate, etc.)                      |
| **4. Login Service** | JWT-based login and token generation                                  |
| **5. Payment Service** | Handle payment process / mock logic for event booking               |

## âœ… Additional Recommended Services

| Service Name         | Why Add It                                                            |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **6. Event Service**     | Manage events (create, list, update, delete events)                   |
| **7. Booking Service**   | Allow users to book an event â€” link with payment                     |
| **8. Notification Service (Optional)** | Send confirmation emails (optional but adds value)       |

## ðŸ§± Final Microservice Architecture

Here's a structure that balances complexity + timeline:

### ðŸŸ© **1. Eureka Server**
- Registers all services

### ðŸŸ¦ **2. API Gateway**
- Routes `/register`, `/login`, `/events`, `/payment`, etc.
- Adds **JWT Filter** to secure endpoints

### ðŸŸ¨ **3. Registration Service**
- Handles:
  - `POST /register`
  - `GET /users`
- Saves users with roles in MySQL

### ðŸŸ§ **4. Login Service**
- Handles:
  - `POST /login` â†’ returns JWT
- Uses `UserDetailsService`, `JWTUtil`

### ðŸŸ« **5. Event Service**
- Handles:
  - `POST /events` (admin)
  - `GET /events` (all users)
- Stores event details in DB

### ðŸŸ¥ **6. Booking Service**
- Handles:
  - `POST /book` (user books event)
  - `GET /bookings/user/{id}`

### ðŸŸª **7. Payment Service**
- Handles:
  - `POST /pay`
  - Mock logic to simulate payment success/fail
- Connects with Booking + User

---

## âœ¨ Optional

- **8. Notification Service** â€” use Mail API to send booking/payment confirmation.
- **9. Admin Dashboard (Frontend only)** â€” create/manage events, view users/bookings.

### Would you like a diagram to visualize this full service flow?
Or should we now go ahead and **start building the Registration Service** with model/controller/repo/service setup?


Awesome! Based on the models we just discussed, here is a clear and simple **ER Diagram** for your **Event Management System**.

### ðŸ”— Relationships

- `Users` â†’ `Bookings`: One-to-Many (1 user can book multiple events)
- `Events` â†’ `Bookings`: One-to-Many (1 event can be booked by many users)
- `Bookings` â†’ `Payments`: One-to-One (1 booking has 1 payment)

---

### ðŸ’¡ Notes:
- Weâ€™re using **Foreign Keys** (`user_id`, `event_id`, `booking_id`) to link tables.
- You can add indexes and constraints as needed.
- This ERD is perfect for MySQL and aligns with your microservices setup â€” each service can manage its own table, and use IDs to interact via APIs.
